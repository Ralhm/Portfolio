A few highlights that I've picked out and put here for application purposes.

PATHFINDER
My implementation of the A* algorithm, made purely in C++. 

SKILL
The base class of a skill system I designed for a turn-based RPG I've been developing in my spare time in Unreal.
I wanted to make something flexible, allowing for custom skills should they need to be made, while still easy for a designer to amke and edit new skills.

AC_PARKOURMANTLE
An actor component for Urban Nightmare, a first-person parkour game made in Unreal.
We split many of the player abilities, such as wall running, climbing, and grinding, into separate components.
This one in particular handles what happens when a player runs face first into a wall. Do they climb up a ledge, clamber up, or boost over a ledge?
